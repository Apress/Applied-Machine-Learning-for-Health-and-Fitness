    "In the previous chapter you used some of the cloud tools to label and process our data, train the models and register them in the cloud. As a researcher, you are likely to train quite a few models, changing your training script, experimenting with data, before making them available to your customers. This chapter is about making AI a high quality, automated process, that makes it easy to manage your code, publish models and consume them. You'll see the term CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) many times referring to the development cycle in machine learning, and in this chapter I'll be going over some practical examples of taking your research to the level of best practices and standards used in modern data science.\n",

    "Managing models\n",

    "\n",
    "In the last chapter you trained a classification model that can classify images of sport activities. As a data scientist you feel happy: your model converges, it predicts sport activities with good accuracy, and now your customer wants to use it. To make it available for your client, the model needs to be deployed, so you can give your clients something like a link to an API, and then they can use it in their own apps.\n",

    "You already created a script to train your model, another script you'll need is the scoring, or inferencing script, typically named score.py. The script is often specific to your model, in our case we use PyTorch and torchvision, but if you use a different machine learning model library, your script will have a similar structure but use methods specific to your environment and model for inference. The idea is, that the script runs in the context of a Web service or an API. The scoring script needs two methods: init() and run(). The first one, init() is executed once when the container with your model is started, and loads the model and classes into a global variable.\n",

I started with a practical example of deploying the model trained in the previous chapter to the cloud and explaining how to register and manage it. Then I created a scoring script including methods for initialization and inference. I demonstrated how to define our experimental environment, including compute target and dependencies, such as ML framework that will be used in a container running our model. Then I showed how to consume the model via a Web service endpoint: both locally and from the cloud. To create a complete CI/CD automated model training and delivery, I also wrapped these steps into a machine learning pipeline.\n",
