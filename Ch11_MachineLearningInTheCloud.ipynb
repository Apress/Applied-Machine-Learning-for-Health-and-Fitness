    "![](images/ch11/fig_11-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A bulk of machine learning compute tasks today happens in the data centers. As a data scientist, you may have started your research on your local computer, playing with various models, frameworks and sets of data, but there's a good chance that when your project reaches the stage when people start using it, your experiments may need many resources that the cloud provides. The goal of this chapter is going over some examples on how to deploy your data science project to the cloud, store data, train your models and ultimately give your customers access to the predictions the model provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/ch11/fig_11-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of this book when we touched on the tools used by data scientists, you remember that we discussed virtual environments. In a virtual environment it's easy to isolate a set of tools and libraries needed by one experiment from another. Such an environment would typically include a list of libraries and dependencies making it relatively easy to replicate a set of components for your project. Containers take virtual environments even further. With containers you can package your data science experiment and models, together with all supporting components, and when you are ready, distribute everything to a data center, or make it a cloud service. Even if you don't use containers explicitly, most cloud services today are using them behind the scenes to isolate and package your resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, you are familiar with various ways to get Python on your system. What's the docker way to get it up and running? This one liner runs Python in a new docker container on your system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -it python:3.7 python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The magic that happens here is that even if this version of Python is not installed on your system, docker will pull it from the online repository of images, create a container and start Python shell in that container:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unable to find image \\'python:3.7\\' locally\n",
    "3.7: Pulling from library/python\n",
    "Status: Downloaded newer image for python:3.7\n",
    "Python 3.7.7 (default, Mar 11 2020, 00:27:03)\n",
    "GCC 8.3.0 on linux\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in the book we used lots of Jupyter notebooks. But what if your notebook requires a set of components that you need to configure in a different environment? Conveniently, you can also run notebooks from a docker container, and the Jupyter team has provided a set of public images you can start with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/scipy-notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When this container starts, you should be able to connect to a fully functional notebook through the Web browser. Docker containers have become de facto standard for packaging and distributing applications. A template with a set of instructions on what defines your package is called an *image*, and you can create your own image with a *Dockerfile*. A container is essentially an instance of an image. As a practical data scientist, if you work with the cloud you may occasionally need to wrap your model into a container.\n",

    "Running Jupyter notebooks on your local machine is not the only way to run your data science experiments with some great (and often free to start) services available today: most major cloud vendors provide services that can get you started quickly with the notebooks. For starters some of the major notebook services available today include Microsoft Azure Notebooks, Google Colaboratory and Amazon. Beyond offering basic Jupyter notebooks, they often provide a set of tools that simplify managing machine learning workflows, getting and processing data etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data in the Cloud\n",
    "=================\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important advantages of developing your machine learning experiments in the cloud is the use of cloud-based storage. Storage in the cloud is a relatively inexpensive resource that you can easily scale, with added benefits of security, durability and high availability across different geographical regions and accessibility anywhere in the world from many languages and platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project: Using cloud storage for machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters, when we discussed various ways to capture data from athletes, I mentioned IMUs, inertial measurement unit that can aggregate data from several sensors: accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers to provide accurate high frequency information about athlete movements. To illustrate the use of this data in the machine learning environment in the cloud, I provided a motion capture file of a high-level skier performing slalom turns. This data was captured using high-quality mocap with Xsens suit that combines multiple sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to storing data in the cloud, as a data scientist you are likely to spend some time parsing the file and getting it into various models for training and further processing. In the example below, we'll load an output from such a set of IMUs, into the cloud-based machine learning workspace. The following code snippet takes a comma separated file containing center of mass data and creates a tabular dataset, registering it in the cloud workspace:\n",

    "Labeling data in the cloud\n",
    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "For machine learning tasks like classification and object detection you'll often need to label data for training. In the previous chapters, when we discussed deep computer vision and classification, when you used a labeled dataset of different sport activities and a pretrained model to classify activities. If you recall, we had two classes of actions: 'tennis' and 'surfing' and we trained our model with a set of pre-classified images. We also used transfer learning from a pretrained model, which reduced our need in the number of images we supplied for the model. The task of labeling data in the cloud often needs to be done by a distributed team, with thousands of images, and the cloud comes very handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is labeled, it can be exported as in COCO format (Common Objects in Context), the standard we used earlier in the book when we experimented with human body poses to store joints information.

In this chapter we looked at some familiar tasks, like using notebooks, loading and processing data, labeling, classification and training your models. Everything you've done on your local computer with notebooks (and more!) you can do in the cloud. In this chapter you learned how to take a familiar task, like an image classification for different sport activities and create a pipeline for training it in the cloud. Some new concepts include creating an environment for your experiment, including Python packages dependencies, defining a compute target to run your training and registering your model in the cloud environment."
