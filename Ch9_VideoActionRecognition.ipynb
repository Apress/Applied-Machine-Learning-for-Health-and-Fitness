    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Our brain is a super-fast action recognition system that's hard to match. In terms of deep learning our brain routinely does many things to recognize actions, and it works *fast*! It may be years of evolution, the need to identify incoming danger or provide food: each of has a miraculously fast video action recognition engine that just works. Our brain is capable of *normalization* and *transformation* since we recognize actions regardless of viewpoint. Human brain is great at *classification*, telling us what's moving and how, and it can also *predict* what's coming next. Turns out, our knowledge of deep learning for action recognition is getting close, but it's not as good just yet. Especially, it becomes clear when generalizing movements: the brain is far ahead of neural nets in its ability to generalize. Although if data science keeps the same pace of evolution as in the last decade, perhaps AI may get closer to the human brain.\n",

    "Recognizing actions from videos is key to many industries: sport, surveillance, robotics, health care and many others. For a practical sport data scientist or a coach, action recognition is part of the daily job: coach's eye and experience is trained to do movement analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In biomechanics, we use physical or classical mechanics models to describe movement. This approach worked for many years in sports science, but analytical methods are complicated and as history shows: although movements can be described with classical mechanics, deep learning methods can be more efficient and often demonstrate great precision. To illustrate this point: Kinetics dataset described in this chapter contains 400 activity classes with hundreds of sport activities recognition readily available. You can classify any of those activities with an average level computer, and you really don't need a PhD in biomechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/ch9/fig_9-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetics dataset has 650,000 video clips, covering hundreds of human actions and totaling close to a terabyte of data. That looks like a lot, but for each sport it covers only a few basic moves. A human ski coach evaluating a skier can narrow it down to dozens of small movements and usually deals with multiple training routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Video recognition has been traditionally tough for deep learning because it needs more compute power and storage than most other types of data: that's a lot of power and storage! In the recent years, video recognition methods, models and datasets made a significant progress to the point that they became practical for a sport scientist. As this chapter shows, these methods are also relatively easy to use with the tools, frameworks and models available today. In this chapter, we focus on practical use and methods for video action recognition. You don't need advanced hardware, but a GPU enabled computer is recommended. If you don't have that handy, using an online service like Microsoft Azure or Google Colab that offers free scaleable compute service for data science.\n",

    "Video classification has been an expensive task because of the need to deal with the video, and video is heavy. In this chapter you'll learn data structures for video, used across most of datasets and models for video recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single image, or video frame can be represented as a 3D tensor: (width, height, color), color depth having three channels: RGB. A sequence of frames can be represented as a 4D tensor: (frame, width, height, color). For video classification, you will typically deal with sequences, or batches of frames, and the video is represented as a 4D or 5D tensor: (sample, frame, width, height, color).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to read a video into structures ready for deep learning, frameworks provide convenience methods, such as PyTorch's torchvision.io.read\\_video. In the following code snippet, the video is loaded as a 4D tensor 255 (frames) x 720 (height) x 1280 (width) x 3 (colors). Notice, that this method also loads audio, although we are not going to use it for action recognition:\n",

    "import torchvision.io\n",
    "\n",
    "video_file = 'media/surfing_cutback.mp4'\n",
    "\n",
    "video, audio, info = torchvision.io.read_video(video_file, pts_unit='sec')\n",

    "> *- Carreira, Zimmerman \"Quo Vadis? Action Recognition\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Quo Vadis is Latin means: \"where are you going?\". Although action recognition is achievable from a still frame, it works best when learning from temporal component as well as spatial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/ch9/fig_9-4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the still frame it's not easy to tell whether the person is swimming or running. Perhaps, this ambiguity in action recognition prompted authors of research article on Kinetics video dataset and Two-Stream Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) architecture to name the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to Kinetics, Sports-1M used to be a breakthrough dataset, in authors' own words:\n",
    "\n",
    "> To obtain sufﬁcient amount of data needed to train our CNN architectures, we collected a new Sports-1M dataset, which consists of 1 million YouTube videos belonging to a taxonomy of 487 classes of sports.\n",

    "> Andrej Karpathy et al, \"Large-scale Video Classiﬁcation with Convolutional Neural Networks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, deep learning for video recognition focused on activities that were easily available. What source of video data, can a data scientist use without the need to store terabytes of videos? YouTube comes very handy, as well as any other online video service! You'll notice that many of the action recognition datasets use online video services because those videos are typically indexed, can be readily retrieved and often have additional metadata that helps classifying entire videos or even segments. In fact, with massive online video repositories, storing billions of movements and deep learning, we are on the verge of revolution in movement recognition!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some well-known datasets for human video action sequences include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   HMDB 51 is a set of 51 action categories, including facial, body movements and human interaction. This dataset contains some sport activities, but is limited to bike, fencing, baseball and a few others. Included in PyTorch: torchvision.datasets.HMDB51\n",
    "\n",
    "-   UCF 101 is used in many action recognition scenarios, including human-object interaction, body motion, playing musical instruments and sports. Included in PyTorch: torchvision.datasets.UCF101\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Kinetics is a large dataset of URL links to video clips that covers human action classes, including sports, human interaction etc. The dataset is available in different sizes: Kinetics 400, 600, 700 and is included in PyTorch: torchvision.datasets.Kinetics400\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "While video presents many challenges: computational cost, capturing both spatial and temporal action over long periods of time, it also presents unique opportunities in terms of designing data models. Over the last few years, researchers experimented with various approaches to video action recognition modelling. Methods that prove most effective so far, are using pretrained networks, fusing various streams of data from video, for example motion stream from optical flow and spatial pretrained context [e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2199.pdf].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Modern models use fusion of context streams: for example temporal and spatial for action recognition](images/ch9/fig_9-5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some earlier methods tried experimenting and benchmarking model performance with various context streams, for example using different context resolutions with something authors creatively called a \"fovea\" stream in one research and the main feature learning stream.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Project 9-1. QuickStart Action Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides a quick start for video classification: the goal is to have a practical sport data scientist quickly started on the human activity recognition. Before we start on this project, let's take a look at the list of human activities we can classify with minimal effort. I'll be using PyTorch here, because it provides video classification datasets and pretrained models out of the box. PyTorch computer vision module, torchvision, contains many models and datasets we can use in sports data science, including classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, person keypoint detection and video classification. Video classification models and datasets included with PyTorch, are what we'll be using for this task to get started quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch video classification models are trained with Kinetics 400 dataset. Although not all of these human activities are sports related, I put together a helper in utils.kinetics, conveniently, it provides a list of sport related activities:"

We discussed data structures for loading, normalizing and storing videos, datasets for sports action classification, such as Kinetics, and deep learning models. Using readily available pre-trained models, we can classify hundreds of sport actions and train the models to recognize new activities. For a sport data scientist, this chapter provides practical examples for deep learning, movement analysis, action recognition on any video.\n",

    "Although video action recognition is becoming more usable today, and made progress in thousands of classifications, we are still far from the goals of generalized action recognition. That means, as a sport data scientist, you are still left with a lot of work to apply video recognition in the field. Is this the right time to make video action recognition a part of your toolbox? With practical examples and notebooks accompanying this chapter, I think that this is the right time for coaches and sport scientists to start using these methods in everyday sport data science. "
