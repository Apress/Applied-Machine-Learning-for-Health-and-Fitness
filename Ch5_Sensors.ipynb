In biomechanical analysis, *sensors* are devices that provide experimental data. We can use data collected from sensors in machine learning models.\n",

    "Sensors also have very practical consumer applications: from helping athletes progress at sports to assisting coaches with movement analysis, providing feedback, logging and recording data. The goal of any coach is to help athletes improve performance and prevent injuries: with machine learning methods, the possibility of a virtual sports and fitness assistant becomes reality.\n",

    "Although I use the term sensor, but the meaning is a broader set of IoT devices that include, besides the sensing unit (such as: an optical sensor, a gyroscope, an accelerometer), a sensor processing unit (SPU), capable of computing and processing sensor data onboard. Similarly, other edge devices for example TPU (tensor processing unit), VPU (vision processing unit) or HPU (holographic processing unit). The actual sensing devices are often called microelectromechanical systems (MEMS): most are inexpensive and can be easily integrated in custom boards.\n",

It's often impossible to capture micro-movements and forces of a downhill racer, moving at 100 mph down Strife, a famed Austrian downhill run in Kitzbuhel, but when equipped with the right sensors, we can capture data for biomechanical analysis, with data points available hundreds of times per second. In this book we'll use various IoT devices that can be used for sports data collection: computer vision cameras, image raging sensors, such as LIDARs, inertial measurement units (IMUs), attitude and heading reference systems (AHRS), inertial navigation systems (INS/GPS), pressure and electromyographic sensors, and others.\n",

What's truly fascinating about visual data, is that we can still use archive images of the athletes and sports of the past and apply machine learning methods to understand their technique. The cover of this book and Figure 2-2 also reflects the importance of computer vision in applications for sports: the magical beauty of ancient Greek discus thrower, dated back to 2,000 years, overlaid with the results of finding key body joints using a multi-layer convolution neural net.

In chapter covering in-depth movement analysis, I will demonstrate how to apply deep learning methods to estimate key activities for various sports, something that would be impossible just a few years ago: for example detect bottom turn and cutback in surfing, identify phases of skiing turns etc.\n",

    "There's a new class of devices for edge that starts taking shape, and it's coming from the need to do an onboard machine learning, for example for robotics or self-driving cars. Most companies started to make boards with similar specs, fitting the profile of data science on the edge. The idea is to provide on-device computer vision capabilities in a small cost-efficient form factor. The list of new application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) supporting tensor and matrix math required for deep learning at the edge keeps growing. Basically, the edge vision setups include a camera, a MicroSD card or storage to keep data while offline, WiFi for online connectivity, a TPU or specialized circuit for accelerated processing, and a runtime for inference.

    "Most machine learning libraries require a co-processing unit to accelerate computation. Historically, computers had at least one co-processor, the GPU, primarily used to accelerate graphics. GPU has most of what deep learning computation needs: multi-core parallel execution and memory.\n",

In addition, CUDA toolkit provides a rich set of GPU optimized processing: for linear algebra (cuBLAS), fast Fourier transform (cuFFT), cuSOLVER (for dense and sparse direct solvers), cuSPARSE (sparse matrix), CUTLASS (custom linear algebra algorithms) etc. Most machine learning libraries come prepackaged for CPU or GPU, the later has more dependencies but offers higher performance. For example, running sport activity body pose estimation on a CPU can get us 0.2-2 FPS, with GPU we can easily get 15-20 FPS. For deep learning inference, NVIDIA has TensorRT for graph optimization and maximizing performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Inertial movement sensors take another approach at measuring movement: these devices combine accelerometers, gyroscopes, in some cases magnetometers to measure acceleration, rotation and direction. There're several reasons why these devices are absolutely fantastic for sports: for cameras you need a line of sight, while IMUs can be attached or integrated in clothing, do not require a line of sight, do not suffer from occlusion and provide data at much higher frequency. What it means for a practical sport scientist or a coach: with IMU you don't need to see the athlete, or point a camera at the field, IMUs will capture body movements. Tradeoffs often include the need to calibrate devices and the need to charge multiple sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "With IMUs we can easily apply mechanical terms to movement analysis. Accelerometer readily provides acceleration, or changing velocity data:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$acceleration = \\ \\frac{\\text{change\\ in\\ speed}}{\\text{change\\ in\\ time}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For rotational movement, gyro provides angular motion information:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$angular\\ velocity = \\frac{\\text{change\\ in\\ angle}}{\\text{change\\ in\\ time}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From Newton's second law, we know that acceleration helps linking kinematics and kinetics, the acceleration of the body is directly proportional to the magnitude of the unbalanced force, and the acceleration of the body is inversely proportional to the mass of the body:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$force = \\ acceleration*mass$$\n",
    "\n",
    "IMUs typically provide six or nine \"degrees of freedom\" (6DOF or 9DOF), that is measurement of movement with 6 or 9 pieces of data: acceleration (x,y,z), angular rotation (x,y,z)and magnetic force (x,y,z). This data is provided at high frequency of up-to 200 Hz.\n",

    "IMU devices have come a long way from the IMU pictured on Figure 2-13, which shows a drawing of an Apollo 5 IMU, used for navigation in space back in 1968, mainly thanks to MEMS technology that fits an integrated IMU, containing accelerometer, a gyro and a magnetometer all in a tiny 4 square millimeter component. There're several integrated edge devices with embedded IMUs, including one myself and my partners built, pictured on Figure 2-14. These sensors are good for kinematic analysis of multiple sports, including basketball, tennis and skiing, if you are willing to accept certain limitations, such as the need to charge and calibrate (more on IMU analysis see Part III).\n",

    "Take Olympic downhill for example: the famed Kitzbuhel Streif has a length of more than 3 kilometers, with a vertical drop of almost a kilometer, maximum angle of 85 degrees and many curves, blocking cameras. Skiers reach speeds of 145 km/h: it is nearly impossible to provide an accurate continuous line of sight camera coverage there, with a precision required to monitor every joint of the skier! But when equipped with IMUs (better even a suit that has IMUs built in, like an xSens for example), we can record data from 17 sensors, reading every joint of the body at a rate of 200Hz, regardless of the terrain complexity! The trick? Placing all those sensors on the body, calibrating them, saving data. However, data scientists should be fascinated by the quality of data coming from these devices, especially for good high precision datasets!\n",

    "![](images/ch5/fig_5-16.png)\n",

    "There're many ways to apply these devices for sports data science. One of the advantages is very high frequency of measurement (in addition to standalone devices, any mobile phone these days is equipped with an IMU): a linear accelerometer typically reads at 100Hz, very few cameras can provide data at that rate, gyroscope returns a 3D vector, providing angular rate of 200-2000 dps (degrees per second). Magnetometers provide data in gauss range 2-16 gauss. Together, IMUs consist of solid-state or microelectromechanical (MEMS) gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers.\n",

    "The key addition AHRS to the set of three IMU sensors is the system that computes *attitude* and *heading*. Such a system typically employs a filter to combine the output of sensors. In small systems we may use Complementary, Mahony, Madgwick, or Kalman filters for data fusion. These filters take raw accelerometer and gyro data and calculate an orientation quaternion or Euler's angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "AHRS has many applications: during my work on sensors, I met Cyrus Hostetler, a brilliant javelin thrower, and an Olympian on the US Olympic Team, who came up with an idea of attaching an IMU sensor to javelin. We quickly put a prototype together (see Figure 2-12). After some tweaking with the hardware and printing a 3D case that fits the javelin, we were ready to test.\n",

    "Navigation systems, or GNSS (the term that includes GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou and other regional systems) have become a household name for getting from point A to point B. We rely on these systems, with receivers built into many devices, including our phones, to get directions. My earliest venture into the world of GNSS was building Active Fitness and Winter Sports apps: both rely on location API in the phone to track running, walking, skiing, snowboarding along with 50+ other activities for more than 2 million users.\n",

    "![](images/ch5/fig_5-19.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "While these systems provide geo-positioning data (latitude, longitude, sometimes elevation and calculated speed), the best frequency at which these devices can provide data is about 1-10Hz (compare that with 100Hz for an IMU!). In downhill, skiers often reach speeds of 90 mph (44 meters per second) or more, that means that with GNSS rate of 1-5 times per second we will miss most skier's turns information that is crucial to the coach and the athlete. In reality, our precision is in the range of 5-10 meters, not sufficient to get a smooth curve of a single skier's turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sports it means that we can get an approximate course of the skier on the slope, but not a smooth curve of a turn with GNSS alone!\n",
    "\n",
    "The satellite signal for GNSS is not always available: even while skiing in the mountains, satellite signal can be easily blocked by rocks and trees. To overcome that, inertial navigation systems (INS) continuously calculate position by *dead reckoning* and using IMUs (accelerometer, gyro and magnetometer) to estimate a calculated position. From physics we know that acceleration is the first derivative of velocity by time, and the second derivative of displacement by time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = \\frac{\\mathbb{d}v}{\\mathbb{d}t} = \\ \\frac{d^{2}s}{dt^{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since IMUs provide acceleration data, in order to estimate at what speed and how much we moved relative to dead reckoning, we need to integrate acceleration to get speed, and then integrate speed to get displacement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = \\ \\int_{}^{}\\text{adt},\\ \\ \\ s = \\ \\int_{}^{}\\text{vdt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, integration accumulates an error, or drift. With time drift can be very significant, getting a new reading from the geolocation unit helps correcting it, but if the signal is lost for a significant amount of time? More advanced INS systems that require centimeter level precision, use real-time kinematic (RTK), a complex method involving an additional baseline or base station.\n",
